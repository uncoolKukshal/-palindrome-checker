# -palindrome-checker

A palindrome checker is a program or function that determines whether a given input, typically a string, reads the same forwards and backwards. In other words, it checks if the characters of the input string are arranged in such a way that it remains the same even when reversed.
for example :-
Word: "level"

Reading it backward: "level"
Since it reads the same backward and forward, "level" is a palindrome.
Phrase: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"

Removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase: "amanaplanacanalpanama"
Reading it backward: "amanaplanacanalpanama"
Since it reads the same backward and forward, "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" is a palindrome.
